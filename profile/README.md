<h1><span class="selected">Urocare Flora Guard Review: An Honest Look at This Probiotic for Lasting UTI Relief</span></h1>
<h2><span class="selected">What is Urocare Flora Guard and How Does It Differ from Traditional Treatments?</span></h2>
<p><span class="selected">First, let's be clear: </span><strong><span class="selected">Urocare Flora Guard</span></strong><span class="selected"> is not an antibiotic. It won&rsquo;t kill an active, raging infection in its tracks. Instead, it&rsquo;s a proactive, preventative tool designed to stop those infections from ever taking hold in the first place.</span></p>
<p><span class="selected">Think of your vaginal microbiome as a garden. A healthy garden is lush with diverse, beneficial plants (good bacteria, primarily </span><em><span class="selected">Lactobacilli</span></em><span class="selected">) that naturally keep weeds (harmful bacteria like </span><em><span class="selected">E. coli</span></em><span class="selected">) from overgrowing. Antibiotics are like a powerful weed killer. They do a great job of eliminating the immediate problem, but they are indiscriminate&mdash;they wipe out the good plants along with the weeds. This leaves the garden barren and vulnerable, creating the perfect environment for the hardiest weeds to grow back even faster and stronger.</span></p>
